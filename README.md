ProsperoStore is a homebrew app store that runs natively on the PS5. Title ID `PPSA99000`.
It is an alpha; the current version is the newest one on the
[releases page](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ProsperoStore/releases).

> [!WARNING]
> **ProsperoStore includes an exact-title one-shot helper built from upstream
> [PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon).** The PS5 jailbreak
> environment must provide [ShadowMountPlus](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus)
> ([1.7beta4](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus/releases/tag/1.7beta4) or newer
> recommended) and a local ELF loader on TCP port 9021. If a resident Lapy service is already running, the store asks
> it first; otherwise it sends the packaged helper over that local connection, so no separate Lapy
> payload is needed. Installs, updates and uninstalls have run on firmware 6.02 and 12.70. Other
> firmware is experimental; the helper refuses runtime layouts it does not know instead of guessing.

## Features

- **The whole [homebrew.page](https://homebrew.page) catalog** - Discover shows one app big over
  shelves (New and updated, Apps, Games, Tools, Coming soon, On this console); each section has its
  own grid, with search by name or developer and sorting by name, release or update.
- **One-button installs** - Cross on an app's page downloads it, checks it against the signed
  catalog, unpacks it and puts it in place. A ring, four steps (Download, Verify, Unpack, Finish)
  and the time left show the progress; Circle cancels, and nothing changes until the end.
- **Updates** - apps installed with the store are offered their newer versions (the Updates
  section, or Update all). A running app is never touched until it is closed. An update replaces
  the app's whole folder; the previous folder, with anything you had put inside it, is kept in
  `/data/prosperostore/previous/<TITLE ID>` (or `prosperostore/previous` on the app's drive) until
  that app's next update, so files of yours are never lost. Move them back by FTP if you need them.
- **Clean uninstalls** - hold the Uninstall button: the app's folder goes and so does its
  home-screen tile. Its saved data stays.
- **Fast file work** - unpacking and removing run in a helper started through the payload loader,
  which the console does not slow down: Kodi's 2,700 files unpack in about 25 seconds.
- **Apps you installed by hand** - an app the catalog lists can be handed over to the store
  (Manage with ProsperoStore) and is updated from then on.
- **Any install location** - the folders ShadowMountPlus scans on the internal drive, an extended
  drive or a USB drive, chosen in **Settings**.
- **It updates itself** - when a newer ProsperoStore is listed, its own page offers it; see
  [Updating ProsperoStore](#updating-prosperostore).
- **Looks and feel** - each app's picture is made from its own icon's colours, with a soft
  opening animation, background music, interface sounds and springy motion. **Reduce motion** is
  in **Settings**.
- **Keyboard support** - a USB keyboard works as well as the controller; see [Controls](#controls).
- **A QR code on every app's page** - opens the app's page on homebrew.page, with its release
  notes and source.

## Install

> [!TIP]
> **Use [ShadowMountPlus 1.7beta4](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus/releases/tag/1.7beta4)
> or newer**, especially on newer firmware. It mounts ProsperoStore from the folder (or drive) you
> copy it to, and it also mounts `/data` and USB and extended storage drives into the app's
> sandbox. Older versions may not register the store or give it access to `/data`, which shows
> as "Read only" in the store.

1. Make sure the console runs ShadowMountPlus 1.7beta4 or newer and a payload loader on port 9021
   (see the warning above).
2. Download `PPSA99000.zip` from the release and unzip it. A release ZIP built by the workflow can
   be checked with `gh attestation verify PPSA99000.zip -R blackbearreloaded/ProsperoStore`
   (GitHub CLI); this covers releases built by GitHub Actions from now on, not earlier ones.
3. Copy the `PPSA99000` folder into a folder ShadowMountPlus scans, for example
   `/data/homebrew`, so that `eboot.bin` ends up at `/data/homebrew/PPSA99000/eboot.bin` (not one
   folder deeper).
4. Wait a few seconds for ShadowMountPlus to add it to the home screen, then open ProsperoStore.

> [!NOTE]
> **"Can't start the game or app" (CE-107750-0) after copying the folder?** The console only
> starts an app whose files are open to every user (permissions `777`), and what copies the files
> decides their permissions. Some FTP servers and programs upload them as `755` or `644`.
>
> - Set `PPSA99000` and everything inside it to `777` with your FTP program (often "File
>   permissions", applied to subfolders and files), then open the store again.
> - To avoid it next time: the [ftpsrv](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/ftpsrv) payload writes
>   uploads with the right permissions, and in WinSCP a transfer preset with "Set permissions"
>   `0777` does it for every upload.
> - Updates done from inside the store, and apps the store installs, are set to `777` for you.

The store keeps its own data in `/data/prosperostore` (settings, cache, install records and
logs), outside the app's folder, so updates keep it.

## Updating ProsperoStore

When [homebrew.page](https://homebrew.page) lists a newer ProsperoStore, the store asks when it
opens: **Update now**, **What's new** (the release notes) or **Skip**. The store's own page
(**Settings > ProsperoStore**) offers the update too. It downloads and unpacks like any app; then
the store closes, a small helper started through the payload loader puts the new files in place,
and a notification says when to open it again. The next start runs the new version. Versions
before 1.000.020 show a short notice at the top right instead of the question.

Updating from inside the store is the easy way. To update by hand, replace the `PPSA99000` folder
with the one from the new release; if the console then says it can't start the app, see the note
about permissions under [Install](#install).

## Reporting a problem

If the store shows no apps, stays offline or can't install something, switch on **Debug log** in
**Settings** (Options button), close the store and open it again, and repeat what failed. The
store then records each step it takes: the access it was given, the network requests, the
catalog and every install.

Send one of these with your report:

- a photo of **About**, where the **Debug trace** section lists the steps (scroll for all of it);
- the file `/data/prosperostore/debug-trace.txt`, fetched by FTP;
- if the store couldn't write to `/data`: `ProsperoStore-debug-trace.txt` on a USB drive that was
  plugged in before the store was opened.

Say which console and firmware you have, your ShadowMountPlus version and your payload loader.
The log holds no account details or passwords. Switch **Debug log** off again afterwards: while
it is on, the store starts a little slower.

## Custom catalogs

**Settings → Development options** has two switches, one for each source:

- **Official catalog** - homebrew.page, always signature-checked. On by default.
- **Custom catalog** - your own feed. Switching it on asks for its address when none is set.

With both on, the custom catalog's apps are added to homebrew.page's and carry a "Custom catalog"
mark on their page. Where both list the same title ID, the official app is the one shown, and the
store says how many custom apps were hidden. With only the custom catalog on, it replaces the
official one, which is what you want to test a new version of an app that is already listed. The
store needs one catalog, so the official one can only be switched off while a custom one is in
use.

**Custom catalog URL** is the HTTPS directory containing the feed, for example
`https://example.com/api/v1/`: the API directory, not the website homepage, a GitHub repository
URL or `index.json`. **Restore official catalog** goes back to homebrew.page alone. Changes are
saved at once and apply when you close and reopen ProsperoStore.

**Verify custom catalog signatures** is on by default and uses the official catalog's built-in
public keys, so it suits a copy of the signed official feed. For an independently published feed
you can turn it off after confirming the warning; the store then labels the catalog **Signatures
not checked**. Only do this with a publisher you trust: hashes detect changed downloads, but an
unchecked publisher controls both the download address and its expected hash.

Custom feeds must implement the [catalog API](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-catalog/blob/main/docs/api.md):
schema-3 `manifest.json`, `index.json`, `versions.json`, and `apps/<TITLEID>.json`.
The manifest must list the SHA-256 of each API JSON file. `manifest.sig` is required
only while signature verification is on. API-file hashes, artifact hashes, ZIP
validation, HTTPS certificate checks, and the existing GitHub release download
policy remain enforced. Plain HTTP, self-signed TLS certificates, arbitrary JSON
lists, and downloads from non-GitHub artifact hosts are not supported.

Each API URL and signature mode has its own catalog cache. Re-enabling verification
never reuses an unchecked catalog; the official signed catalog retains its saved
rollback protection. Signature checks off also disables sequence rollback checks,
so development feeds can rebuild with a lower sequence. Store update notices use
the selected catalog, and app QR codes use its `page` URLs.

## Roadmap

Ideas for what a solid app store should do, in no promised order. Some need changes to the
[catalog](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-catalog) as well as to the store.

### Versions and updates

- **Install an older version** - pick a past release on an app's page and install it; an app held
  at a version is left alone by Update all.
- **Roll back in one press** - put back the previous version the store already keeps after an
  update, with the files you had inside it.
- **Skip or hold updates** - "don't offer this update" or "never update", for each app.
- **What's new before updating** - the release notes for every app in the Updates list, as the
  store already shows for itself.
- **Automatic updates** - optionally update apps when the store opens, all of them or only the ones
  you mark.

### Finding apps

- **Categories and tags** - emulators, media, streaming, utilities, beyond App, Game and Tool.
- **Collections** - curated shelves such as "Start here" or "Emulators".
- **Screenshots** - pictures of the app on its page.
- **Popularity** - download counts, and sorting by them.
- **Favourites** - a list kept on the console.
- **Search in descriptions** - not only names and developers.

### Trust and safety

- **What an app does outside its sandbox** - a short list on its page, from the catalog's scan of
  each release.
- **Firmware and requirements** - which firmware an app was tested on and what it needs
  (ShadowMountPlus version, Lapy, extra files), checked before installing.
- **Report a problem with an app** - a QR code to the app's issue page, with the console's firmware
  and the app's version filled in.

### Managing what is installed

- **Storage view** - the size of each app, the previous versions the store keeps and its caches,
  with a way to clear each.
- **Move an app** - between the console's storage, a USB drive and the extended drive.
- **App data** - show where an app keeps its data, and offer to remove it when uninstalling.
- **Back up and restore app data** - to a USB drive.
- **Repair** - check an installed app against the catalog and reinstall it when it differs.
- **Export the installed list** - and install everything again on another console.

### Downloads

- **Resume interrupted downloads** - large apps start again from zero today.
- **Queue controls** - reorder, pause and retry.
- **Install from a USB drive or a local ZIP** - checked against the catalog when the app is listed.
- **A notification when a download finishes** - through the PS5's own notifications.

### For developers

- **Beta channel** - opt in to an app's pre-releases.
- **Install a test build** - from a pull request or an address, in Development options.
- **Announcements** - a short message from the catalog shown when the store opens.

### Polish

- **Other languages** - follow the PS5's language, as ProsperoEden does.
- **First-run check** - a screen that tests elevation, ShadowMountPlus settings and the network,
  and says what to fix.
- **Open after installing (investigation)** - start an app from the store, if the console allows
  one title to launch another.

## Known limits of this version

- ZIP apps only; image files (ffpfsc) are listed but can't be installed.
- The store installs, updates and removes apps; it does not start them.
- The store updates itself only when it was installed as a folder (not as an image).
- An update is only offered for apps whose catalog entry lists a content version.
- The home-screen name of an app does not change after an update.
- English only.

## Source code

The store's source is in this repository: the app in `src/`, the file worker in `helper/`, the
host previews and checks in `host/` and `tests/`. Build on Linux (WSL works) with
`make DEVELOPMENT=1 app`, or `make app` for a release build without development requests.
`make test lint` runs the host checks. Every pull request gets an installable build named by its
number and commit: see [Pull-request builds](docs/PULL_REQUEST_BUILDS.md). [IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md) records
what was built and how it was verified on consoles, and [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) the design and
decisions. `FOUNDATIONS.json` pins the foundation sources, and `third_party/STORE_SOURCES.json` the
vendored libraries. The store reads the catalog API at `https://homebrew.page/api/v1/`, specified
in [the catalog's `docs/api.md`](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-catalog/blob/main/docs/api.md).

## Project foundation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The catalog is [homebrew.page](https://homebrew.page)**, built from
> [ps5-homebrew-catalog](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-catalog). Developers list
> their apps there, and ProsperoStore installs what it lists.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Built on the [PS5 Native App Boilerplate](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate)**,
> the native foundation also used by ProsperoEden and ProsperoLight: application structure,
> runtime, packaging, sandbox elevation and the self-update helper.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The interface is built with [ps5-homebrew-ui](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-homebrew-ui)**
> and drawn with [ps5-opengl](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-opengl).
